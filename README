The project aims to build a Wikipedia Indexer with following goals:

1. Parse fairly involved Wikipedia Markup. I did this using the SAX Parser. The reason for choosing a SAX Parser over 
the DOM Parser is the large size of Input. DOM parsers load the entire xml file into the main memory before parsing. A SAX 
parser is much more efficient and Parses the xml file using events.

2. Index a Decent sized subset of Wikipedia corpus. Successful run on 1600 wikipedia pages and minor issues with a corpus 
of 4000 Wikipedia Pages which has been fixed.

3. Create Multiple indexes on the page data as well as metadeta.

4. Provide an index introspection mechanism that can later be built upon to support queries.
